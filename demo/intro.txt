Project:
End to End Message Transmission with Encryption and Authentication using Socket Programming

Features:
Client transmits files (text or binary) or anything sent to the client's stdin (until EOF) to the server.
The server saves the files and prints the messages recieved to the server's stdout.

The message is encrypted using AES256-CBC, and then HMAC-SHA256 is applied to both the
encrypted payload and the encryption IV.

The encrypted payload, the IV, and the HMAC signature are all converted to base64 strings
and concatenated together, separated by "." (inspired by JSON Web Tokens https://jwt.io).

The server verifies the signature on the transmitted information before attempting to decrypt the payload.
If an attacker modifies the encrypted payload or the IV, the signature will not match. If the signature
is modified, it also will not match. This provides integrity over the entire message.

It is especially important to authenticate the payload because the encrypted message is actually a
serialized data structure (using the built-in Python pickle library). This library says that it
is important not to deserialize an object from an untrusted source. Because the message is successfully
authenticated, we consider it trusted (and not maliciously constructed).
